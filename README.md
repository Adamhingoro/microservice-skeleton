## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the basic skeleton for microservices using ExpressJS - TypeScript - Sequilize. what I am trying to do is that if I could create a simple structure with all the must-have-components of a microservice and build a CI/CD, Testing and development features around it then we can easilly use this skeleton and build services faster. 

## Contribution 

I highly encourage the developers to contribute and simple way is that you have to make a seperate branch and make a pull request in the end. Please make sure it passes all the tests and linters. other wise the pull-request will be rejected. 

### branch-naming

name your branch wisely. example branch names are `feature-events-sourcing` and `fixed-issue-no-1234`. please use dashed-names. 

I have used the standard readme structure and everything beyond this line is not the part of this project. I will write it later.
